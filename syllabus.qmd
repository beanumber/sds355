### Description

In sports analytics, we apply methods from the statistical and data sciences to sports to address fundamental questions of interest to players, coaches, team executives, journalists, and fans alike. 
Simple questions (e.g., who are the best players?) are complicated by the interdependent nature of team sports, the omnipresence of randomness (i.e., luck), and frequent changes to personnel, rules, equipment, league alignments, and other structures.
However, in many ways sports provides an ideal laboratory for applied statistical analysis, as many sports generate copious amounts of data under regularized conditions. 
In this course, students will explore the big ideas in sports analytics (e.g., expected points, win probabilities, team strengths, etc.) and how they manifest across a variety of different sports. 
They will develop a working knowledge of the most prominent statistical models for sports analytics and apply them to a variety of public sources of sports data. 
The course will conclude with a research project on a topic and sport of the student's choosing.


### Prerequisites

SDS 192 and SDS 210 or the equivalent

### Learning goals

- Demonstrate technical understanding on the major concepts in sports analytics
- Use statistical software to access and analyze public data about sports
- Translate analytical frameworks across different sports, where applicable

## Content

### Expectations

This is a 4 credit course, meaning that by federal guidelines, it should consume about 12 hours per week of your time. We meet for 2.5 hours per week. That means **you should be spending about 9.5 hours per week**, or nearly 2 hours per day, on this course **outside of class.** 

::: {.callout-warning}
You should be spending about 9.5 hours per week on this course outside of class.
:::


My goal is to help you achieve the [learning goals](#learning-goals) for this course using only the mental model you have built of the material we have covered, and *without* the aid of generative AI. 
While I accept the ubiquity of generative AI, I believe that helping you build your mental model of this material is where I can best contribute to your education. 
To that end, much of our time in class and many of our assessments will take place in AI-free environments. 
Other learning will take place [outside of class](#expectations), wherein [you are free to use AI in whatever fashion you want](#use-of-generative-ai) (unless otherwise noted), provided that it is in compliance with [Smith's Honor Code](#academic-honor-code-statement). 

Please understand that while AI may be helpful to you in building your mental model of the material, it will not be available to you during many of our assessments, and I am comparatively less interested in your ability to complete tasks while using AI than I am in your ability to demonstrate knowledge using only your brain (and body). 

This perspective applies to all course content, including mathematical equations and R code. 


### Grading & Assignments

The learning and assessments in this course are centered around three main components:

- (10%) Engagement: Attending class meetings, being active on [the course Slack channel](#communication), participating in class discussions, and offering ideas and questions in class or on Slack are all ways of demonstrating engagement. Your engagement grade will be determined by me in consultation with periodic self-assessments completed by you. 
- (15%) Bi-weekly homework/lab assignments: These assignments will include problems that allow you to working with data and analyze the results
- (20%) Midterm exam: a written exam
- (20%) [Colloquium presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquium): You will choose a published research paper in sports analytics, and during the second half of the semester, you and a partner will present the paper to the class. 
- (35%) Research project: a 10-page [Quarto Manuscript](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/) and a 3-minute class presentation. 

Please see the [schedule](schedule.qmd) for the most current due dates.

#### Extensions

I value your ability to meet deadlines and manage your own workload.
I am also a reasonable person who understands that life happens and this is not always possible. 
Extensions up to 48 hours will typically be granted *when requested at least 48 hours in advance* without requiring a reason or an explanation. 
Longer extensions, or those requested within 48 hours of a deadline, will typically not be granted. 
Please plan accordingly. 
Please note that because many of the assignments in this class are collaborative, individual extensions for group assignments will be problematic. 
**All extended deadlines will appear on Moodle.**


## Policies {#policies .unnumbered}

### Inclusion

I am committed to fostering a classroom environment where all students thrive. 
I am committed to affirming the identities, realities and voices of all students, especially those from historically marginalized or underrepresented backgrounds. 
I am dedicated to creating a space where everyone in the class is respected, is free from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, gender identity, disability status, and other identities, and feel welcome and ready to learn at your highest potential. 

If you have any concerns or suggestions for how to make this class more inclusive, please reach out to me. 
**I am here to support your learning and growth as data scientists and people!**

### Attendance

You choose whether you will attend class. 
If you choose to attend, I expect your full attention. 
If you choose not to attend, you accept responsibility for any lost educational value. 

::: {.callout-important}
We hope it goes without saying that during class, you should not use your computer or cell phone for personal email, web browsing, social media, or any activity that's not related to the class. 
:::

### Collaboration

Much of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are
expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small
groups to study, complete assignments, and work on projects.
However, **all work that you submit for credit must be your own**. 


::: {.callout-important}
Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or *blocks of code* from another student or from online sources is not acceptable and will receive no credit. 
:::

No interaction with anyone but
the instructors is allowed on any exams or quizzes. All students, staff
and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code, which Smith has
had since 1944.

### Use of Generative AI 

`r button("Important", button_type = "danger")`

Unless otherwise noted (such as for exams and oral presentations), generative AI can be used whenever you are outside of class. 
However, **please read [my perspective](#perspective)** on learning and generative AI. 
Please understand that careless and excessive use of generative AI will likely impede your ability to achieve the [course learning goals](#learning-goals). 

::: {.callout-warning}
Remember that generative AI is not *intelligent*, doesn't *think*, and has no idea what is *true* or *false*. 
You are solely responsible for the veracity of anything (e.g., code or text) you submit. 
:::

### Academic Honor Code Statement {#honor-code}

> Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations.
Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.

Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.

### Code of Conduct `r button("Important", button_type = "danger")`

As the instructor and assistants for this course, we are committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" names, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

As the instructor and assistants we have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.

::: {.callout-important}
All students, the instructor, the lab instructor, and all assistants are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: lectures, labs, office hours, tutoring hours, and over Slack.
:::

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.0.0, available [here](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/).


## Resources {#resources .unnumbered}

### Moodle and course website

The [course website](http://beanumber.github.io/sds410/) and Moodle will be updated regularly with lecture handouts, project information, assignments, and other course resources. Homework and projected grades will be submitted to Moodle. Please check both regularly.

### Computing

The use of the R statistical computing environment with the [RStudio](http://rstudio.org) interface is thoroughly integrated into the course. You have two options for using RStudio:

* The **server** version of [Posit Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/) on the [web](http://posit.smith.edu/). The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer with a web browser (Firefox is recommended) and an Internet connection. 
* A **desktop** version of [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) installed on your machine. The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, and you will have to manage your own installation. 

Note that you do not have to choose one or the other -- you may use both. 
However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. 
Both R and RStudio are free and open-source, and are installed on most computer labs on campus. 

Unless otherwise noted, you should assume that it will be helpful to bring a laptop to class. It is not *required*, but since there are no workstations in the classroom, we will need a critical mass (i.e. at least 12) computers in the classroom pretty much everyday. 

### Communication

- `r fontawesome::fa("slack")` [Slack](https://sds-410-01-202503.slack.com/) is the primary forum for course-related discussions of all kinds. *Please do not email me with course-related questions!* Instead, post those `#questions` on Slack. If discretion is absolutely necessary, private message me on Slack. 
- `r fontawesome::fa("github")` [GitHub](http://www.github.com/sds-capstone/) will host all of the code for projects associated with this course. All repositories are private by default.

::: {.callout-important}
It is very important that all project-related communication take place in Slack or GitHub channels that all group members can see! Private texts and side conversations will very quickly lead to other group members feeling excluded. 
:::

### Writing

Your ability to communicate results---which may be technical in nature---to your audience -- which is likely to be non-technical---is critical to your success as a data scientist. 
The assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing.

This course is part of Smith College's [Writing Enriched Curriculum](https://www.smith.edu/academics/jacobson-center/writing-enriched-curriculum). 
As such, the course supports the [Writing Plan of the Program in Statistical & Data Sciences](https://www.smith.edu/sites/default/files/media/Documents/Jacobson-Center/SDS-WritingPlan-accessible.pdf). 

Please read the [SDS Writing Plan](https://www.smith.edu/sites/default/files/media/Documents/Jacobson-Center/SDS-WritingPlan-accessible.pdf) for more information.
