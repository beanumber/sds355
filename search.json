    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nInclusion\nI am committed to fostering a classroom environment where all students thrive. I am committed to affirming the identities, realities and voices of all students, especially those from historically marginalized or underrepresented backgrounds. I am dedicated to creating a space where everyone in the class is respected, is free from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, gender identity, disability status, and other identities, and feel welcome and ready to learn at your highest potential.\nIf you have any concerns or suggestions for how to make this class more inclusive, please reach out to me. I am here to support your learning and growth as data scientists and people!\n\n\nAttendance\nYou choose whether you will attend class. If you choose to attend, I expect your full attention. If you choose not to attend, you accept responsibility for any lost educational value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe hope it goes without saying that during class, you should not use your computer or cell phone for personal email, web browsing, social media, or any activity that’s not related to the class.\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete assignments, and work on projects. However, all work that you submit for credit must be your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCopying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of code from another student or from online sources is not acceptable and will receive no credit.\n\n\nNo interaction with anyone but the instructors is allowed on any exams or quizzes. All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code, which Smith has had since 1944.\n\n\nUse of Generative AI\nImportant\nThis course has a flexible policy towards the use of generative AI tools.\n\nUse:\n\nIn writing code: The use of generative AI is permitted in this course as long as you cite the tool you used and understand what the code is doing to the same extent as if you had written it yourself. Specific assignments may have more restrictive use policies.\nIn writing text: The use of generative AI tools is limited to pre-writing activities (e.g., brainstorming, gathering information, organizing an outline, etc.). AI tools are specifically not permitted for writing entire sentences, paragraphs, drafts, or papers to complete class assignments. (Please see the policy on Abuse below.)\n\nAbuse: Attempts to pass off AI-generated content as your own (including but not limited to failure to properly cite generative AI tools) is considered plagiarism and could be a violation of Smith’s Academic Honor Code.\nDisclosure: If you choose to use generative AI as a learning aid, it is essential to disclose its use on your assignments to maintain academic integrity. If you use generative AI, make sure to add a “Generative AI Disclosure” callout block at the bottom of your assignment (see below). Your disclosure should state what program you used and how you used it, including links to the specific prompts you used, if possible. Properly citing the AI-generated content allows me to understand your process better and gives credit to the assistance received from these tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Generative AI Disclosure Statement\n\n\n\nGenerative AI Disclosure: This assignment was supported by use of the AI platform ChatGPT. Specifically, I used GPT 3.5 to assist in the title creation (link here), although the final title was modified slightly. I also used ChatGPT to help me plan my outline (link here). I implemented the chatbot’s recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that generative AI is not intelligent, doesn’t think, and has no idea what is true or false. You are solely responsible for the veracity of anything (e.g., code or text) you submit.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Honor Code Statement\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.\n\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\nCode of Conduct Important\nAs the instructor and assistants for this course, we are committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” names, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor and assistants we have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll students, the instructor, the lab instructor, and all assistants are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: lectures, labs, office hours, tutoring hours, and over Slack.\n\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here."

    "text": "Content\n\nExpectations\nThis is a 4 credit course, meaning that by federal guidelines, it should consume about 12 hours per week of your time. We meet for 2.5 hours per week. That means you should be spending about 9.5 hours per week, or nearly 2 hours per day, on this course outside of class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou should be spending about 9.5 hours per week on this course outside of class.\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nIn thinking about what grade you deserve, I am interested in the following dimensions of learning (in no particular order):\n\nEngagement: How much effort are you putting into this class? How hard are you trying? How respsonsive and accountable are you to your classmates?\nLearning: How much have you learned? What have you learned? What are the things that you can do at the end of the class that you couldn’t do at the beginning? When you look back on this class, what will you tell people that you learned from this experience?\nProficiency: How well are you able to perform the tasks required of your assignments for this class? How knowledgeable are you about the topics covered in class, or the various elements of your project?\n\n\n\nAssignments\nThe learning in this course is centered around three main components:\n\n(20%) Bi-weekly homework/lab assignments: These assignments will include components of working with data and analyzing the results\n(30%) Midterm exam: a written exam\n(50%) Research project: a 10-page Quarto Manuscript and a 3-minute class presentation.\n\nPlease see the schedule for the most current due dates.\n\nExtensions\nI value your ability to meet deadlines and manage your own workload. I am also a reasonable person who understands that life happens and this is not always possible. Extensions up to 48 hours will typically be granted when requested at least 48 hours in advance without requiring a reason or an explanation. Longer extensions, or those requested within 48 hours of a deadline, will typically not be granted. Please plan accordingly. Please note that because many of the assignments in this class are collaborative, individual extensions for group assignments will be problematic. All extended deadlines will appear on Moodle."

    "text": "Resources\n\nMoodle and course website\nThe course website and Moodle will be updated regularly with lecture handouts, project information, assignments, and other course resources. Homework and projected grades will be submitted to Moodle. Please check both regularly.\n\n\nComputing\nThe use of the R statistical computing environment with the RStudio interface is thoroughly integrated into the course. You have two options for using RStudio:\n\nThe server version of Posit Workbench on the web. The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer with a web browser (Firefox is recommended) and an Internet connection.\nA desktop version of RStudio IDE installed on your machine. The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, and you will have to manage your own installation.\n\nNote that you do not have to choose one or the other – you may use both. However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source, and are installed on most computer labs on campus.\nUnless otherwise noted, you should assume that it will be helpful to bring a laptop to class. It is not required, but since there are no workstations in the classroom, we will need a critical mass (i.e. at least 12) computers in the classroom pretty much everyday.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n Slack is the primary forum for course-related discussions of all kinds. Please do not email me with course-related questions! Instead, post those #questions on Slack. If discretion is absolutely necessary, private message me on Slack.\n GitHub will host all of the code for projects associated with this course. All repositories are private by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is very important that all project-related communication take place in Slack or GitHub channels that all group members can see! Private texts and side conversations will very quickly lead to other group members feeling excluded.\n\n\n\n\nWriting\nYour ability to communicate results—which may be technical in nature—to your audience – which is likely to be non-technical—is critical to your success as a data scientist. The assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing.\nThis course is part of Smith College’s Writing Enriched Curriculum. As such, the course supports the Writing Plan of the Program in Statistical & Data Sciences.\nPlease read the SDS Writing Plan for more information."
