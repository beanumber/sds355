    "text": "Content\n\nExpectations\nThis is a 4 credit course, meaning that by federal guidelines, it should consume about 12 hours per week of your time. We meet for 2.5 hours per week. That means you should be spending about 9.5 hours per week, or nearly 2 hours per day, on this course outside of class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou should be spending about 9.5 hours per week on this course outside of class.\n\n\n\n\nPerspective\nMy goal is to help you achieve the learning goals for this course using only the mental model you have built of the material we have covered, and without the aid of generative AI. While I accept the ubiquity of generative AI, I believe that helping you build your mental model of this material is where I can best contribute to your education. To that end, much of our time in class and many of our assessments will take place in AI-free environments. Other learning will take place outside of class, wherein you are free to use AI in whatever fashion you want (unless otherwise noted), provided that it is in compliance with Smith’s Honor Code.\nPlease understand that while AI may be helpful to you in building your mental model of the material, it will not be available to you during many of our assessments, and I am comparatively less interested in your ability to complete tasks while using AI than I am in your ability to demonstrate knowledge using only your brain (and body).\nThis perspective applies to all course content, including mathematical equations and R code.\nYou can read more about my thoughts on generative AI in education.\n\n\nGrading & Assignments\nThe learning and assessments in this course are centered around three main components:\n\n(10%) Engagement: Attending class meetings, being active on the course Slack channel, participating in class discussions, and offering ideas and questions in class or on Slack are all ways of demonstrating engagement. Your engagement grade will be determined by me in consultation with periodic self-assessments completed by you.\n(15%) Bi-weekly homework/lab assignments: These assignments will include problems that allow you to working with data and analyze the results\n(20%) Midterm exam: a written exam\n(20%) Colloquium presentation: You will choose a published research paper in sports analytics, and during the second half of the semester, you and a partner will present the paper to the class.\n(35%) Research project: a 10-page Quarto Manuscript and a 3-minute class presentation.\n\nPlease see the schedule for the most current due dates.\n\nExtensions\nI value your ability to meet deadlines and manage your own workload. I am also a reasonable person who understands that life happens and this is not always possible. Extensions up to 48 hours will typically be granted when requested at least 48 hours in advance without requiring a reason or an explanation. Longer extensions, or those requested within 48 hours of a deadline, will typically not be granted. Please plan accordingly. Please note that because many of the assignments in this class are collaborative, individual extensions for group assignments will be problematic. All extended deadlines will appear on Moodle."

    "text": "Policies\n\nInclusion\nI am committed to fostering a classroom environment where all students thrive. I am committed to affirming the identities, realities and voices of all students, especially those from historically marginalized or underrepresented backgrounds. I am dedicated to creating a space where everyone in the class is respected, is free from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, gender identity, disability status, and other identities, and feel welcome and ready to learn at your highest potential.\nIf you have any concerns or suggestions for how to make this class more inclusive, please reach out to me. I am here to support your learning and growth as data scientists and people!\n\n\nAttendance\nYou choose whether you will attend class. If you choose to attend, I expect your full attention. If you choose not to attend, you accept responsibility for any lost educational value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe hope it goes without saying that during class, you should not use your computer or cell phone for personal email, web browsing, social media, or any activity that’s not related to the class.\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete assignments, and work on projects. However, all work that you submit for credit must be your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCopying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of code from another student or from online sources is not acceptable and will receive no credit.\n\n\nNo interaction with anyone but the instructors is allowed on any exams or quizzes. All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code, which Smith has had since 1944.\n\n\nUse of Generative AI\nImportant\nUnless otherwise noted (such as for exams and oral presentations), generative AI can be used whenever you are outside of class. However, please read my perspective on learning and generative AI. Please understand that careless and excessive use of generative AI will likely impede your ability to achieve the course learning goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that generative AI is not intelligent, doesn’t think, and has no idea what is true or false. You are solely responsible for the veracity of anything (e.g., code or text) you submit.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Honor Code Statement\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.\n\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\nCode of Conduct Important\nAs the instructor and assistants for this course, we are committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” names, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor and assistants we have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll students, the instructor, the lab instructor, and all assistants are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: lectures, labs, office hours, tutoring hours, and over Slack.\n\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here."

    "text": "Resources\n\nMoodle and course website\nThe course website and Moodle will be updated regularly with lecture handouts, project information, assignments, and other course resources. Homework and projected grades will be submitted to Moodle. Please check both regularly.\n\n\nComputing\nThe use of the R statistical computing environment with the RStudio interface is thoroughly integrated into the course. You have two options for using RStudio:\n\nThe server version of Posit Workbench on the web. The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer with a web browser (Firefox is recommended) and an Internet connection.\nA desktop version of RStudio IDE installed on your machine. The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, and you will have to manage your own installation.\n\nNote that you do not have to choose one or the other – you may use both. However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source, and are installed on most computer labs on campus.\nUnless otherwise noted, you should assume that it will be helpful to bring a laptop to class. It is not required, but since there are no workstations in the classroom, we will need a critical mass (i.e. at least 12) computers in the classroom pretty much everyday.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n Slack is the primary forum for course-related discussions of all kinds. Please do not email me with course-related questions! Instead, post those #questions on Slack. If discretion is absolutely necessary, private message me on Slack.\n GitHub will host all of the code for projects associated with this course. All repositories are private by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is very important that all project-related communication take place in Slack or GitHub channels that all group members can see! Private texts and side conversations will very quickly lead to other group members feeling excluded.\n\n\n\n\nWriting\nYour ability to communicate results—which may be technical in nature—to your audience – which is likely to be non-technical—is critical to your success as a data scientist. The assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing.\nThis course is part of Smith College’s Writing Enriched Curriculum. As such, the course supports the Writing Plan of the Program in Statistical & Data Sciences.\nPlease read the SDS Writing Plan for more information."

    "text": "Audience\nYour final deliverable will be to write up your project as an academic paper. For your convenience, the format should conform to the Undergraduate Research Project Competition (USRESP) guidelines. If possible, you are strongly encouraged to submit your paper to the competition, but that decision will not affect your grade in this class. The paper should be 12–15 pages long, plus references, and an appendix (of arbitrary length) in which you can show more graphics, tables, etc.\n\nUse your GitHub repository to write the paper. Put the paper contents into a subdirectory called quarto-manuscript.\nUse GitHub issues to delegate certain tasks to certain people, and to keep track of your progress.\nUse the Manuscripts feature to write the paper in Quarto.\nOne submission per group.\n\n\nThe structure of a scientific paper\nMost commonly, research papers will have five sections like:\n\nIntroduction and Motivation: What is the problem you are trying to solve? Why is this problem interesting? What has been tried before? What have been the shortcoming of those approaches that necessitate your efforts? Often, this section will conclude with a subsection (or paragraph) outlining “our contributions.” What is the new knowledge that this paper contributes?\nData: Where did it come from? What are some basic summary statistics, variable definitions, and/or visualizations that help the reader understand the data you are working with? Tables and figures are strongly encouraged here.\nMethods: What did you actually do? What techniques or methods did you employ? What were the specifications for any statistical models you used? What software or packages did you use or develop?\nResults: What did you learn about the problem you identified in Section 1? This is where you put the tables, figures, and analytics by-products of your work.\nConclusion: What are the limitations of your work? What are some next steps that someone (either you or another research group) should consider in attempting to further your work? Remind us one last time about what you did.\n\n\nReferences: Every reference (except for books) needs a URL. Use Google Scholar to help with BibTeX. Every book needs publisher location. 🙄 The format is Publisher City: Publisher Name.\n\nOptionally, if you have more stuff:\n\nAppendix: Include supplementary graphs and tables in an appendix. The reader may or may not read the appendix.\n\n\n\nFeedback from previous drafts\nThe following common feedback applies to all groups. Please read carefully – these are mandatory recommendations.\nGeneral feedback:\n\nUse an academic writing style. Use the present tense (in almost every case), even when writing about previously published papers or work that you did two months ago. Use “we” to describe your efforts. Avoid the passive voice!\nUse examples, screenshots, or peeks at data to illustrate what you are talking about.\nDon’t be afraid to get technical – this is a scientific paper. However, if you are going to invoke technical terms or concepts, you have to either explain them or give a citation to a reference that does.\nFocus on problems and solutions. What were the problems that your client had? How did you solve them? Don’t just narrate about what you did – connect the work that you did to the problems that existed before you started. If you find this hard to do, perhaps what you are writing about doesn’t need to be in the paper.\nRevise, then revise again.\n\n\n\nEthical statement\nYour final paper must include an ethical statement. The ethical statement may be relegated to the appendix at your discretion.\n\nDrawing on what you have learned about data science ethics in this class, discuss any ethical considerations in your project. For some projects, this statement could be quite short (one paragraph may suffice). For other projects, more detail may be needed (no more than 2 pages).\nBe expansive and creative in your thinking about possible ethical considerations. One way to do this assignment poorly would be to write a short statement asserting that there are no ethical considerations, only to have me think of several fairly obvious ones."

    "text": "In a colloquium, there is usually a different speaker each week. During the second half of the semester, our class will run as a quasi-colloquium, wherein you will take turns presenting a sports analytics paper to the rest of the class. This seminar is very common in graduate school, and is a great way to learn how to read a research paper at a deep level.\nYour presentation should take about half of the class period (i.e., 35-40 minutes). Your goal is maximize each other student’s understanding of the paper by the time they leave the room.\nHere is some advice and ground rules:"
